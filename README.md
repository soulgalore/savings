Check how much you can save in KB in one page
==============

Background:
The project has been built to check how much web pages can save by following performance best practices rules like optimize images, minify html/js/css and compress html/js/css. The original idea was to check the biggest sites in Sweden (according to http://kiaindex.org), but now it also supports checking against one url.

The backend is Google Page Speed API.

You can run it like this:
KiaIndexSavings pathToKiaFile GoogleAPIKey

or
SavingsForOneURL URL GoogleAPIKEy
